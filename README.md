A light weight addon which allows you to move 
and anchor your mouse-over tooltip frame.

Simply click and drag the box around your UI 
and that is where your mouse-over tooltips will appear.

Click one of the white boxes to choose the direction in which the tooltip frame draws.

By default, the frame draws from the top left to the bottom right (ie: the top left button). 
If you click the bottom right button then the frame would draw from the bottom right to the top left (ie: the frame draws up and to the left).

See screenshots for more examples or just play around yourself and see which direction suits you best!

Once you're happy with it's placement, simply goto Options > Addons > KBOCD Tooltip Anchor and then uncheck the option to display the frame.

Note: The inspiration to make this addon was the discontinuation of WeakAuras (and certain older addons that are not updated for WoW 12.0 or above). 
I'm OCD with my layouts, hence the naming of this addon.

I always like having my mouse-over tooltip in a specific location and for it to draw in a specific direction. 
I was never able to find an addon that did this without fully replacing the ingame tooltip; so I decided to make one myself. 
I hope for those people like me they find this useful. Enjoy! - KurenBatsu
